# A Big Thanks

## Motivation

I really enjoy thinking about how things can be improved and make life for others. I talk a-lot about it at work but I want to take that further and start talking more in the community. 
I hope that I also help others from reading my blog but also give back and have people from outside my team challenge the way I think and support me when I make a mistake. 
The plan is also to start blogging about my failures and talk about the learnings. I think its really important to take time to look back on where things went wrong and how to avoid them in the future.

## Why did I use a template and not build a blog myself?

I have tired to make a few blogs in the past, but after a week and getting 3/4 there, I would get distracted or something would come up. When I got back to it, I had new priorities or wanted to focus on something else. For this site, I want to focus on the content and not the coding.
